Additionally, it provides an excellent way for employees or business owners to present data to non-technical audiences without confusion.\nIn the world of Big Data, data visualization tools and technologies are essential to analyze massive amounts of information and make data-driven decisions."

    "text": "Cumulative Distribution Function\nEvery continuous distribution has cumulative distribution function (CDF). The CDF defines the proportion of the data below a given value for all values of a :\n\n\n\nCumulative Distribution Function (CDF)\n\n\nAs defined above, this plot of the CDF for male heights has height value a on the x-axis and the proportion of student with heights of that value or lower(F(a)) on the y-axis.\nThe CDF is essential for calculating probabilities related to continuous data. In a continuous dataset, the probability of a specific exact value is not informative because most entries are unique. For example, in the student heights data, only one individual reported a height of 68.8976377952726 inches, but many students rounded similar heights to 69 inches. If we computed exact value probabilities, we would find that being exactly 69 inches is much more likely than being a non-integer exact height, which does not match our understanding that height is continuous. We can instead use the CDF to obtain a useful summary, such as the probability that a student is between 68.5 and 69.5 inches.\nFor datasets that are not normal, the CDF can be calculated manually by defining a function to compute the probability above. This function can then be applied to a range of values across the range of the dataset to calculate a CDF. Given a datasetmy_data, the CDF can be calculated and plotted like this:\nR语言中的[apply()]，[lapply()]，[sapply()]，tapply()函数以及示例\n\n\nshow the code\n# Cumulative Distribution Function \na <- seq(min(x), max(x), length) # define range of the values\ncdf_function <- function(x) {\n    mean(my_data <= x)\n}\ncdf_values <- sapply(a, cdf_function)\nplot(a, cdf_values)\n\n\n\n\nshow the code\n# example for student heights\na <- seq(min(heights$height), max(heights$height), length = 100)\ncdf_function <- function(x){\n  mean(heights$height <= x)\n}\ncdf_value <- sapply(a, cdf_function)\nplot(a, cdf_value)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CDF defines that proportion of data below a cut-off a. To define the proportion of values above a, we compute: 1-F(a)\nTo define the proportion of values between a and b, we compute: F(b)-F(a)\nNote that the CDF can help compute probabilities. The probability of observing a randomly chosen value between a and b is equal to the proportion of values between a and b, which we compute with the CDF."
