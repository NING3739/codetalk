# Welcome to Stats & R!!!
:::

This is a personal website with the contents of **statistics** and the **open-source** [R](https://www.r-project.org/) **language**, aiming to facilitate **academic exchanges** and better **promote myself**.

If you are new to this site, here are some useful suggestions that you can do.

-   On the [posts page](posts.qmd), some **interesting ideas** (how to use R to make a 3D Christmas tree, etc.) for daily life will be presented.

-   The [about page](about.qmd) is a good place where you can quickly get to know **who I am** and **what I am doing now**.

-   The [series page](series.qmd) will display my **independent projects** and R language **study notes**.

-   If you have any questions, please go to the [contact page](contact.qmd) to **get in touch with me** directly.

Thanks again for coming to my personal website.ðŸ˜˜
