# Welcome to Stats & R !!!

This is a personal website with **Statistics** and the open source language [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) as the main content, aiming to **facilitate academic exchanges** and **better promote myself**.

If you are new to this site, you will notice that the site is made up of four sections: Blog, About, Works and Contact.

Here are some useful suggestions that can help you use this site smoothly.

-   The **Blog** page, **some interesting ideas**(how to use R to make a 3D Christmas tree, etc.) in daily life will be presented.

-   The **About** page, a good place where you can quickly get to know **who i am** and **what i am doing now**.

-   The **Works** page, **Independent projects**, and R language **study notes** will be showing here.

-   If you have any questions, please go to the contact page to get in touch directly.

Thanks again for coming to my personal website, i hope it can be helpful for your concern.
