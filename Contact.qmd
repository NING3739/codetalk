Thanks in advance for contacting me.

In order for me to answer you as soon as possible, here are **the best communication methods**:

-   Due to the increasing number of questions received, responding to each of them by email has become unmanageable and unproductive. Therefore, if you have a question, I invite you to **add it as a comment** at the end of the corresponding article. This way, **other readers can benefit** from the discussion and that saves me from answering the same thing several times. Questions by email will not be answered (I will redirect you to the comments).

-   For mistakes, bugs or inconsistencies---and that can happen, we are all human after all---you can inform me about them by raising an issue on GitHub. If you are familiar with GitHub, you can even edit the corresponding file and propose a pull request so I can quickly include your changes.

-   For a quick answer to your question, make sure to first check the comments from other readers. Your question may have already been answered.

Thank you !!!
