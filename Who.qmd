Hi, I' m ***Ning*** and I'm a potential data analyst.

My current focus is ***statistics***, ***R-based data analysis*** and ***corporate-related political risk issues***.

My background is in ***Accountancy***. If you have any doubts about corporate auditing issues, maybe i can help you.

I really hate graphical interface data analysis software, because it always gives me extra results that I didn't ask for.

My current short-term goal is to publish my first ***peer-reviewed paper*** and start my ***PhD*** by 2023.

In my free time, I like listening to ***music***, ***hiking*** and ***reading***. If you also like these activities, please feel free to contact me.

## Education

Massey University, Auckland \| Master in Accountancy \| February 2019 - June 2020

## Experience

Life Maid Easy \| Head Marketing \| December 2020 - present
